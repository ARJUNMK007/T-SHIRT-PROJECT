# PROJECT_THREEJS_AI
The project is all about setting up an t-shirt 3d web-app that user can change the color logo and its full texture. 
also can ask AI to generate images for the fulltexture and logo through the web app.
the shirt model is implemented using  three js which is a strong library for adding and designing 3d images in the website.
Users can download the t-shirt that designed using the web-app and keep it for further use like they can even make it real through the t-shirt makers.
This can helpfull to those who are searching for t-shirt models and create unique t-shirt for clubs and groups.
Even everyone can upload their own photo as logo or full texture.
